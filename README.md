# ArduinoPlayPianoTiles
It's a arduino based robot able to play piano tiles game.
Used Hardwares:
  4 relay switches
  4 22k resisters
  4 LDR sensord
  1 Arduino UNO board
  1 breadboard
  4 aluminium coins
  
  
Here first you need to check sensivity of your LDR sensor.
for that use test_ldr code.
and set value of ldr sensivity accordingly in main.ino file.

Then you need to test touch for aluminium coins.
use test_touch code for it.

finally upload main.ino file and set the hardware and sensors as per shown in schemetics.

thank you.....
